Java Primitive
Integer
* byte: 8 bits, -128, 127
* char: 16 bits, 0, 2^16 - 1
* short 16 bits, -2^15, 2^15 - 1
* int, 32 bits, -2^31, 2^31 - 1
* long, 64 bits, -2^63, 2^63 - 1
FLoating-point
* float, 32 bits
* double, 64 bits

Negative Integers in Java
* Two's complement. Negative numbers are representing by negating (flipping) all the bits and then adding 1. Still, if the leftmost bit is 0, the number is positive. Otherwise, it is negative.
